          <h1><b>What is Formula 1?</b></h1>
          <nav>
              <p>Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international auto racing for single-seater racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).</br>
                A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix (French for 'grand prizes' or 'great prizes'), which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on closed public roads.</br>
            After each Race players receive Championship points, the better position you are in the race, the more points, if you finish 11-20 you receive no points unless you have a fastest lap where you get 1 point.</br>
        There are also points awarded to the constructors (Teams) based on their position in the race.</p>
