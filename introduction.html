          <h1><b>What is Formula 1?</b></h1>
          <nav>
              <p>Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international auto racing for single-seater racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).</br>
                A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix (French for 'grand prizes' or 'great prizes'), which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on closed public roads.</br>
            After each Race players receive Championship points, the better position you are in the race, the more points, if you finish 11-20 you receive no points unless you have a fastest lap where you get 1 point.</br>
        There are also points awarded to the constructors (Teams) based on their position in the race.</p>

          <h2><b>F1 Rules</b></h2>
          <nav>
              <p>F1 rules are quite simple but yet complicated, there are many race rules such as Race Flags and DRS.</br>
            The Race flags are "Yellow, Green, Blue, Black, Red and Checkered".</br>
        The Yellow Flag means that there is a Danger on the Track and the drivers need to go slowly and keep their delta time at a minimum.</br>
        During Yellow flag, there is a potential need for the safety car to come out in case there was a big accident.</br>
        The safety car will set the pace for the F1 cars behind before it goes back to the pit lane, and then the race can continue.</br>
        
        The Green Flag means that the danger has passed and the race can continue as normal.</br>
        The Blue Flag warns the driver that they are about to be overtaken by a faster vehicle (if they are lapped by them). </br>
        The Black Flag means that a driver is disqualified because of his reckless driving. </br>
        The Red Flag means that the race has been suspended eiter because of a big accident or a really bad weather contiditons. </br>
        The Checkered Flag is the flag at the end of the race where in the final lap of the race the cars are passing the finishing line.</p>

            <p>DRS (Drag Reduced System) Rule is simple, there are certain DRS zones on the track </br>
            and if you are behind the car by less than 1 second, you can open your DRS and it will make you faster.</p>
