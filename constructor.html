          <h3><b>How much does it cost to build an F1 car?</b></h3>
          <nav>
              <p2>It would be hard to name every single part of an F1 car as there are more than 5,000 of them, but some of the main parts are: </br>
            The Engine ($10.5 million)</br>
            The Chassis ($650,000 - $700,000)</br>
            Steering Wheel ($50,000 - $100,000)</br>
            Fuel Tank ($500,000)</br>
            Brakes ($2,000 - $3,000)</br>
            Hydraulics ($170,000)</br>
            Tires ($2,700)</br>
            As we can see, the approximate price to build an F1 car is around $13.7 million.</p2>

            <p>
                <li2>There are 5 tyre compounds in F1 race. Each team is allowed to have 13 dry, 4 intermediate and 3 wet tires.</li2>
                <li>Red tires are called "Soft tires" and they are the fastest compound out of all, but they do not last long in a race.</li>
                <li>Yellow tires are called "Medium tires", these tires are not as fast as Soft tires, but can go further distance than them.</li>
                <li>White tires are called "Hard tires", the slowest tires out of all dry tires, but they last the longest.</li>
                <li>Green tires are called "Intermediate tires", they are used when the track is a little bit wet, so that the F1 car can have a good grip without slidding.</li>
                <li>Blue tires are called "Wet tires", which by the name you can say that they are used for the heavy rain, they are very usefull for the grip in very heavy rain conditions.</li>

            Red Bull are trying their best to reach Mercedes's levels of speed and beat them in constructor's championship. </br>
            But they are still not as fast as Merdeces, even tho Red Bull has two very talented young Drivers.</p3>

            since 2008, Ferrari has a record of 16 Constructors; Championships.</br>
            Although, that doesn't mean anything because in this season we could've seen that something is wrong with the Ferrari </br>
            as they only finished 6th in the constructors' Championship.</p3>

            Mclaren didn't win a Constructor Championship since 1998. </br>
            They are still one of the most legendary cars out on the track nowadays. </br>
            Their project with Lando and Carlos seemed to be a good one as they finished 3rd in Constructors' Championship.</p3>

            <p3 style="color:yellow"> In the 2020 season. Renault seems like an average team and that was shown in the Constructors' Championship, </br>
            Where they finished 5th. The French team is far away from their 2 phenomenal seasons with Fernando Alonso in 2005 and 2006, </br>where they won the championship 
            There is a lot more work to be done to reach that level.</p3>

            But the overall result was dissapointing as Alphatauri finished 7th in the Constructors' Championship.</p3>

            The Haas team only managed to pick up 3 points in the season and that put them in the 9th place of Constructors' Championship.</p3>

            For the last 2 seasons they have been by far the worst Team in F1, very dissapointing from them. </br>
            Thsi season, they didn't manage to win a single point in the Constructor's Championship which means that they finished last.</p3>
